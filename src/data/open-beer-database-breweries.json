The brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list. Head Brewer Tod Mott arrived in late 2003, bringing with him is award-winning ways and oursized personality.

In the winter of 1984, David Geary began a period of training and research in Scotland and England. With the help of Peter Maxwell Stuart, a Scottish nobleman and brewer who arranged introductions and itineraries, he worked in a half-dozen small commercial breweries from the highlands of Scotland to the south coast of England.", "coordinates": [43.7076, -70.3149], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "Maine", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "D.L.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site This Old House meets the World Wide Web\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdletting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.  He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers. Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order). Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state. Head brewer Casey Hughes now produces four full-time styles, as well as a variety of seasonal beers.   The key word to describe all Flying Fish beers is balance. The beers are full-flavored, yet highly drinkable. Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Hopping is generous, but to style. Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Flying Fish beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, one can walk into any fine restaurant in the Philadelphia region and be pretty sure of finding a Flying Fish beer available. Flying Fish beers were the first in the region to be featured at the Great British Beer Festival, Oregon Brewers Festival and Canada's Biere de Mondial Festival. They have also won several medals at the Real Ale Festival in Chicago, the World Beer Championships and is the only New Jersey brewery featured in the 2000 book Best American Beers.", "coordinates":

We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product.

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990's when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales. Allagash began with the release of its Allagash White, modeled after the traditional White beers of Belgium. Also referred to as wit beers, they get their unique flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, Curacao orange peel and the careful sprinkling of coriander and other spices. Allagash combined these ingredients with their very own proprietary Belgian yeast strain to create the remarkably unique and refreshing beer that is today their flagship brand. Allagash White developed a strong cult following around the Portland area where it was available at selected draft accounts. Due to its immediate success, the beer was soon made available in 12-ounce six-packs throughout the state of Maine. With the success of the first brand, Rob realized two things: The public was asking for some new styles and the workload was getting to be too much for one person. Soon after, two experienced brewers were hired and Allagash released their second brew, Allagash Double Ale. Using the philosophy and techniques created by the Trappist Monks of Belgium centuries ago, the staff created this beer using seven different malts, a traditional sugar, and their own Belgian yeast strain. The result was another unique yet balanced beer crafted in the classic Belgian style. To truly appreciate the classic styles and brewing traditions of Belgium, one must experience beer created in the classic Belgian package. This is why Allagash, after an extensive period of research, released their distinctive Reserve line of cork finished 750 ML bottles. This unique line employs the ancient tradition referred to as the m\u00c3\u00a9thode champenoise. The technique calls for two fermentations, one in the Brewery's fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself. It is this second fermentation that produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer mouthfeel, and beers of remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle, creating what is known as a living beer. As a result, these styles have a greatly enhanced shelf life and some styles will age exceptionally, much like a fine wine. Just as the styles originate in Belgium, so does the package itself. To insure authenticity, Allagash imports the bottles and corks directly from the same country that designed the techniques. This enables the beers to reach carbonation levels similar to champagne while allowing the corks to pop characteristically upon serving. Today, Allagash still remains one of very few breweries in North America using this distinctive package. From the very beginning, Allagash has strived to produce the finest Belgian-style and experimental ales this side of the Atlantic. It began as New England's original Belgian-Style brewery and has grown into one of the industry's most distinguished and well-respected brands. Following the time-tested brewing traditions of ancient Belgium, Allagash now produces a broad-ranging portfolio of artisanal beers with uncompromising quality.", "coordinates": [43.7028, -70.3166], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "Maine", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Allagash Brewing", "id": "23"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-75.3354, 41.0523]}, "properties": {"website": "http://www.barleycreek.com/", "city": "Tannersville", "code": "18372", "phone": "1-570-629-9399", "address1": "RR 1 Box 185", "descript": "Located in Tannersville, right off route 80's exit 299 in between the Crossings Outlet Stores and Camelback Ski area (Camelbeach Water Park, Barley Creek is the Pocono Mountains' Original Brewpub and Restaurant, where you can always find great food, freshly brewed beer, a comfortable atmosphere, friendly people, and a unique place to kick back, relax and have a great time.

Their family had roots in the beer industry as well.  Their grandfather worked for Schlitz driving a street sweeper and a truck.  Russ Klisch remembers him bringing home short fills to his dad.  He recalls, even as a kid, that it was a cool job if you got to bring beer home at night.  Taverns were also owned by several family members. With that family history and their common interest in beer making, the brothers started their business.  They decided to start small.  Initially, they bought an old pizza bakery building down the street from their home in Riverwest.  They liked the location and the fact that they could walk there from home.  They sold their first barrel on December 2, 1987.  They stayed at that location until winter of 1998.", "coordinates": [43.0547, -87.9053], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "Wisconsin", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Lakefront Brewery", "id": "769"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-123.261, 44.5613]}, "properties": {"city": "Corvallis", "code": "97333", "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "address1": "341 SW Second Street", "coordinates": [44.5613, -123.261], "phone": "1-503-758-3257", "state": "Oregon", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Oregon Trail Brewery", "id": "950"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-104.87, 39.4091]}, "properties": {"city": "Castle Rock", "code": "80109", "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "address1": "880 West Castleton Road", "coordinates": [39.4091, -104.87], "phone": "1-303-814-9273", "state": "Colorado", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Rockyard Brewing", "id": "1070"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-157.858, 21.3069]}, "properties": {"city": "Honolulu", "code": "96817", "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "address1": "580 North Nimitz Highway", "coordinates": [21.3069, -157.858], "phone": "1-808-545-7979", "state": "Hawaii", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Sam Choy's Breakfast, Lunch, Crab & Big Aloha Brewery", "id": "1098"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-110.765, 43.4768]}, "properties": {"website": "http://www.snakeriverbrewing.com", "city": "Jackson", "code": "83001", "phone": "307.739.BEER", "address1": "265 S.

From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale.

The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100 seat brew pub) and were forced to move up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand. Today, we brew over 62,000 barrels of beer and 3,000 barrels of root beer, and we're still growing! But don't let our growth fool you. Our lagers and ales are still brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews. Abita uses only the finest ingredients  British and American barley, German yeast, European and Washington State hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs. In Abita, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way. Abita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered.

The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.", "coordinates": [41.238, -77.0103], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company", "id": "87"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.225, 33.136]}, "properties": {"website": "http://www.greenflashbrew.com", "city": "Vista", "code": "92083", "phone": "1-760-597-9012", "address1": "1430 Vantage Court #104A", "coordinates": [33.136, -117.225], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "California", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Green Flash Brewing", "id": "609"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.157, 32.7153]}, "properties": {"city": "San Diego", "country": "United States", "coordinates": [32.7153, -117.157], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "California", "name_breweries": "On Tap Bistro & Brewery", "id": "945"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-91.2396, 43.8014]}, "properties": {"website": "http://www.taproom21.com/", "city": "La Crosse", "country": "United States", "coordinates": [43.8014, -91.2396], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "Wisconsin", "name_breweries": "Tap Room Brewing Company", "id": "1235"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.871, 38.6112]}, "properties": {"website": "http://www.bearrepublic.com/", "city": "Healdsburg", "code": "95448", "phone": "1-707-433-2337", "address1": "345 Healdsburg Avenue", "coordinates": [38.6112, -122.871], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "California", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Bear Republic Brewery", "id": "94"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-124.153, 40.5793]}, "properties": {"website": "http://eelriverbrewing.com/", "city": "Fortuna", "code": "95540", "phone": "1-707-725-2739", "address1": "1777 Alamar Way", "coordinates": [40.5793, -124.153], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "California", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Eel River Brewing", "id": "481"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.387, 47.5604]}, "properties": {"city": "Seattle", "code": "98116", "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "address1": "4720 California Avenue SW", "coordinates": [47.5604, -122.387], "phone": "1-206-932-8695", "state": "Washington", "country": "United States", "name_breweries": "Elliott Bay Brewery and Pub", "id": "494"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-95.3761, 46.518]}, "properties": {"city": "New York Mills", "country": "United States", "coordinates": [46.518, -95.3761], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "Minnesota", "name_breweries": "Glacial Lakes Brewing", "id": "574"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.3118, 39.9653]}, "properties": {"city": "Ocean", "country": "United States", "descript": "Closed in 1996.", "coordinates": [39.9653, -74.3118], "last_mod": "2010-07-22T16:00:20-04:00", "state": "New Jersey", "name_breweries": "Heavyweight Brewing", "id": "645"}},{"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-70.844, 42.6728]}, "properties": {"website": "http://www.mercurybrewing.com", "city": "Ipswich", "code": "1938", "phone": "978-356-3329", "address1": "23 Hayward St.", "descript": "Located in historic Ipswich, Massachusetts, Mercury Brewing Company emerged in 1999 when Rob Martin, then Director of Operations for Ipswich Brewing Company, purchased the brewery and renamed the company Mercury Brewing and Distribution Company.
